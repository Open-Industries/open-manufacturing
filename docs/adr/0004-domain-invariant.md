## Context

Every vertical has one rule whose violation destroys trust in the platform. Making it a tested code invariant — not documentation — is what makes this core a reference implementation.

## Decision

material issued to production never exceeds available stock — an issue that would overrun stock is rejected (422) and records nothing, so work orders never run on phantom material. The enforcement lives in the operations context's single write path, and the behavior is covered by automated tests (over-draw rejected with 422; state unchanged).

## Consequences

Callers must treat 422 as a normal business outcome; the API standard documents it.
